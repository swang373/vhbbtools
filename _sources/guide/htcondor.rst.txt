========

HTCondor is the batch system of choice on the lxplus and cmslpc computing
clusters. If you're new to HTCondor, there are `thorough examples`_ on how to
submit jobs on cmslpc and even a `full-fledged tutorial`_ for lxplus users.
For more information, the `HTCondor documentation`_ is a valuable resource.

Most of the work in submitting jobs to HTCondor involve wrangling scripts into
a single executable and writing the submit description files. How could one
potentially automate this process? Tune in next time for more documentation.
